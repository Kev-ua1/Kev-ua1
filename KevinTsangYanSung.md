## **Markdown 01: Getting used to Git and Github**

Still learning and familiarizing with Git and Github. I got a good grasp of the various commands/ features such as commit, pull request and fork. Definitely want to get used to Github as fast as I can because this looks quite fun!

The video *Git & GitHub Crash Course 2025* was a great watch and provides great pointers to quickly adapt to Git and Github. Will definitely watch it again in times of need.
